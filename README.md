### Python Covid-19 Analysis
This is a data analysis and visualization project on COVID-19 cases and vaccination data in India. The purpose of this project is to explore and gain insights from COVID-19 data and vaccine data for India.

#### Dataset
The COVID-19 in India dataset available on Kaggle is a comprehensive collection of daily time-series data related to the COVID-19 pandemic in India. The dataset contains information on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries on a daily basis for each state and union territory of India, as well as at the national level. In addition, the dataset also includes demographic information such as age and gender of the affected individuals.

#### Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- Python, and its libraries like: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Covid-19 in India dataset, which can be downloaded from Kaggle

#### Instructions
1.	Download and unzip the dataset from Kaggle
2.	Import the dataset into Jupiter notebook
3.	Do the data analysis using python and its libraries to get the insights from the dataset
4.  After reading and cleaning the data, create visualizations using seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly.express.
5.  The visualizations include:
    - A bar plot showing the top 10 states with the most active COVID-19 cases in India.
    - A bar plot showing the top 10 states with the most deaths due to COVID-19 in India.
    - A line plot showing the growth trends of the top 5 affected states in India.
    - A pie chart showing the distribution of male and female vaccination in India.
    - A bar plot showing the top 5 vaccinated states in India.
    - A bar plot showing the least 5 vaccinated states in India.

#### Conclusion
The objective of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 and vaccination data in India, with the goal of gaining insights that could be useful for policymakers and healthcare professionals. By examining the COVID-19 data, we were able to identify the states that were most impacted by the pandemic, as well as the growth trends in the top 5 affected states. By analyzing the vaccination data, we were able to identify the gender distribution of vaccinations and the states with the highest and lowest vaccination rates. These findings can help inform decision-making and resource allocation strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in India.
